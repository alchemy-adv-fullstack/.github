# Elevator Pitch

An elevator pitch comes from the idea that you could find yourself in an
elevator with a venture capitalist. You have about 30 seconds to pitch your idea
to them before you go your separate ways.

In that 30 seconds, you want to give enough information to the venture
capitalist so they will take interest in your project, which might lead to
funding. It requires you articulate your project idea both clearly and
succinctly.

For a software project, an elevator pitch has a very basic anatomy:

1. What problem have you identified?
2. How does your software solve this problem?

In text form, this covers about 2-3 sentences or a small paragraph.

In addition to your elevator pitch, include any technologies you wish to utilize
that you haven't learned at Alchemy.
